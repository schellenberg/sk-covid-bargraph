# sk-covid-bargraph
The SKGov Twitter account posts a daily pie chart that does a poor job of explaining the case rates in Saskatchewan. This makes a better visual.

## Why Bother?
A pie chart representing what is happening with COVID cases makes the assumption that all cases are coming from a single population. That's not really true. A better way to think about this is to determine the cases per 100k in each of their categories (Not Vaccinated, Partially Vaccinated and Fully Vaccinated). This simple app lets you put in the cases and populations for each of those categories, and it spits out a visual showing a bar graph of the case rates.
